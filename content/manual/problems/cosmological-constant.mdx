# Cosmological Constant Problem

## The vacuum energy isn’t “mysterious.” It’s **uncalibrated**.

The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is usually framed as a mismatch: naive vacuum sums look like a disaster, but the observed vacuum energy density is tiny, about (2.2–2.3 meV)^4. That story has kept physics trapped between three bad options: tuning, anthropics, or modifying gravity.

This program takes a harder line:

> **The CCP is not solved by inventing a new sector or a new symmetry first. It is solved by making the vacuum subtraction non-arbitrary.**
> If you cannot specify the counterterm canonically, you don’t have a physical Lambda, you have a convention.

The papers below provide the evidence; this page provides the unified narrative.

## Central Claim

Within a broad admissible class of prescriptions, the physical cosmological constant (LambdaPhys) is **uniquely selected**, **positivity-compatible**, **RG-invariant**, **time-constant**, and **independent of regulator/window/line choices**.

This is not “we found a neat model.”
This is: **the freedom that creates the CCP is removed by a canonical calibration and stability constraints.**

## Failure of the Standard Framing

In QFT, “vacuum energy” is not a measurable number until you fix a subtraction convention. In orthodox practice, that subtraction is regulator-dependent and is chosen to make the theory workable. That’s fine for lab physics until you couple to gravity, where the subtraction becomes geometry.

So the CCP is, structurally:

* too many “legal” regularizations,
* too much freedom in the constant counterterm,
* and no canonical rule that survives positivity, causality, and RG flow.

This program attacks exactly that freedom.

## The spine of the resolution

The construction has five pillars (each one is load-bearing):

### 1) Fejér–Hardy calibration: kill the fake freedom at the source

A three-window Fejér evaluator enforces:

* **zero DC** (no hidden constant drift),
* **cusp cancellation** (removes the first drift mode),
* **quadratic flatness** (removes the second drift mode)

That combination forces a **universal DC gain**:
WT(0) = 3/(32π) + O(T^-2).

Meaning: the “constant you’re allowed to keep” is not a tuning dial anymore. it’s a fixed intercept, with a falsifiable T^-2 convergence law.

### 2) Certified observables: fix the counterterm with heat-kernel rigidity

The calibration pins the Seeley–DeWitt counterterm via a unique additive constant, using certified combinations of (a0, a2, a4).

So the vacuum subtraction becomes a **derived observable**, not a choice.

### 3) OS-positive spectral bridge: you don’t get to break positivity to “solve” Lambda

The construction builds an order-zero bridge operator:

Q = D + BQG

that is OS-positive and reconstructs to a local Lorentzian QFT with the spectrum condition.

This matters: lots of “CCP fixes” implicitly wreck reflection positivity or causality. This one can’t as it’s built to preserve them.

It also forces a unique atomic coefficient law:
alphak = (32/3) mk.

That is a structural rigidity statement: if you try to alter the bridge, you violate OS positivity or SDW identities.

### 4) Energy inequality rigidity: forbid secular drift

Even if you fix Lambda today, many frameworks allow it to drift slowly with time or state choice. This one forbids that.

It uses:

* state-universal quantum energy inequalities,
* a sharp QNEC with rigidity,
* and a superlinear Lyapunov bound that excludes slow drift (epsilon >= 1/16).

So “Lambda might slowly relax” is not permitted inside the admissible class. The calibrated vacuum energy is locked.

### 5) A compact Lambda-sector EFT: constant curvature shift without on-shell stress

Finally, a compact, anomaly-free hidden sector contributes a constant condensate (LambdaLambda) that produces constant curvature but **no on-shell stress tensor**:

TLmunu = 0 on shell.

This is the “no fifth force” safety valve: you get a geometric shift without introducing a new long-range mediator.

A consistency bound pushes the portal scale high (MLambda >= 10^15 GeV), with MLambda ~ MPl as a clean choice.

## Where the Lambda-field fits: the delta-sector becomes rigid

The CCP paper is not floating alone; it sits on a deeper rigidity result: once collapse/dissipation is represented by a positive generator K >= 0, the allowed scalar “spectral budget” is essentially unique.

That is the canonical Lambda-field:

LambdaT = (1 - exp(-T K)) / (T K)
DT = -log det*(LambdaT)

And the central punch: **once K is fixed, there is no independent functional freedom left in Lambda or its budget (up to bounded zero-point modulation).**

The companion “lambda–Profiles” paper then shows how these budgets behave as lawful, comparable objects across systems (injective, stable, normalizable, and testable as profile curves).

This matters for CCP because vacuum energy is exactly where uncontrolled spectral/dissipative bookkeeping usually explodes. Here it is *rigid* by theorem, not by preference.

## The number is not hand-waved: the meV scale is reproduced

The construction includes an explicit numerical derivation from cosmological parameters:

rhoLambda = 3 MPl^2 H0^2 OmegaLambda

giving rhoLambda^(1/4) ≈ 2.2 meV.

That’s the observed scale obtained without “vacuum sum roulette,” and without inserting a small parameter by hand.

## Predictions and Failure Conditions

This is not a framework that survives by being vague. It comes with crisp falsifiers:

* **w0 = -1 and wa = 0 exactly** (pure cosmological constant, not dynamical dark energy).
* Any significant detection of |w0 + 1| >= 10^-3 or |wa| >= 10^-2 falsifies the construction.
* Any measurable redshift drift of Lambda at >= 10^-3 over a Hubble time contradicts the drift-exclusion bound.
* The Fejér calibration predicts a universal intercept plateau at 3/(32π) with O(T^-2) approach.

In short: it’s rigid enough to be wrong.

## Claims and Non-Claims of This Page

**Claimed:**

* The vacuum counterterm can be fixed canonically from spectral data via a regulator-independent calibration.
* Positivity/causality are preserved (OS positivity + reconstruction).
* LambdaPhys is RG invariant and stable against secular drift.
* The observed meV scale is reproduced from cosmological parameters.

**Not claimed:**

* A landscape scan.
* A new light particle.
* A modification of local GR.
* A “relaxation mechanism” that sneaks tuning back in.
