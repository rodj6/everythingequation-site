# The Yukawa Prediction Problem: A Proven Boundary

**A no-go theorem establishing that exact fermion mass ratios are not
outputs of the Coupled Dirac–$\Lambda$ system, and a precise identification
of what additional structure any predictive extension must supply.**

## The Question Every Unified Theory Must Face

The Standard Model contains 13 free parameters in the Yukawa sector alone.
The electron is about 350,000 times lighter than the top quark. The muon
sits in between at a ratio of roughly 1:200 relative to the tau. The quark
mass hierarchies are even more extreme. None of these numbers have been
explained. They are measured, recorded, and inserted, not derived.

This is the **Yukawa prediction problem**: can a fundamental theory predict
fermion mass ratios from first principles, or are they irreducibly
contingent facts about the particular universe we happen to inhabit?

The question has a long history of optimistic but ultimately inconclusive
answers. Grand unified theories constrain some ratios at the unification
scale, but require threshold corrections and running that reintroduce
freedom. String landscape approaches produce distributions rather than
predictions. Numerological approaches find patterns but lack mechanisms.

The Coupled Dirac–$\Lambda$ framework is the first approach powerful enough
to force the Standard Model gauge group itself, so the question arises
naturally and urgently: does it also predict exact Yukawa ratios?

The answer is proven, not conjectured.

**No. And here is precisely why.**

## What the Framework Already Fixes

Before establishing what cannot be predicted, it is worth being precise
about what the Coupled Dirac–$\Lambda$ system *does* fix because the
Yukawa sector is not undetermined because "nothing is pinned." Several
nontrivial numerical invariants are structural outputs of the same
equation package:

- The **gauge group** $\mathrm{SU}(3)\times\mathrm{SU}(2)\times\mathrm{U}(1)$
  is forced by the double-squeeze mechanism acting on the internal UV load.
- The **spacetime dimension** $d = 4$ is forced by UV–IR scheme compatibility.
- The **hypercharge assignment** is forced (up to sign) by implementability
  and the Witten parity constraint.
- The **Born exponent** $p = 2$ is fixed by the Hilbert–Schmidt flatness
  condition on the moduli-space metric.
- The **fine-structure constant** $\alpha$ and **cosmological constant**
  $\Lambda_*$ are fixed in companion work by spectral boundary conditions.
- The **strong CP phase** $\theta = 0$ is forced by record-bearing
  admissibility.

The saturation system (E8) also locally determines the Yukawa parameter
vector $y^*$ by the implicit function theorem given a fixed background,
fixed active scales, and the nondegeneracy condition $\det D\Phi(y^*) \neq 0$,
the solution is locally unique.

So the Yukawa sector is constrained. The no-go result does not say the
framework is silent on fermion masses. It says something more precise and
more interesting: **exact Yukawa ratios, quantities like $m_e/m_t \approx
2.8 \times 10^{-6}$ - are not law-level outputs of (E1)–(E8) as universal
structural necessities**. They are locally determined given external data,
but they are not globally forced the way the gauge group is.

---

## The Physical Yukawa Manifold

To understand why, one must understand the geometry of the Yukawa parameter
space.

The Yukawa sector is specified by three complex $3\times 3$ matrices
$(Y_u, Y_d, Y_e)$ - the up-type, down-type, and lepton Yukawa couplings.
But these matrices depend on the chosen flavor bases for the chiral
fermion fields. Two configurations related by a flavor-basis rotation

$$
(Y_u, Y_d, Y_e)
\;\mapsto\;
(U_Q Y_u U_u^\dagger,\;
 U_Q Y_d U_d^\dagger,\;
 U_L Y_e U_e^\dagger)
$$

under the flavor-basis redundancy group

$$
\mathcal{G}_3
\;:=\; U(3)_Q \times U(3)_u \times U(3)_d \times U(3)_L \times U(3)_e,
\qquad \dim_{\mathbb{R}}\mathcal{G}_3 = 45,
$$

are physically identical. They predict the same fermion masses, the same
mixing angles, the same CKM matrix entries. They are the same physics
expressed in a different basis.

The **physical Yukawa manifold** is the quotient:

$$
\mathcal{P}_3 \;:=\; \{(Y_u, Y_d, Y_e)\} \big/ \mathcal{G}_3.
$$

Points in $\mathcal{P}_3$ are genuine physical configurations, distinct
predictions about observable mass ratios and mixing angles. The
$45$-dimensional fiber over each physical point is pure basis freedom,
physically invisible.

The question of Yukawa prediction is therefore precisely: does the system
(E1)–(E8) select a unique point in $\mathcal{P}_3$, or does it leave an
open region viable?

---

## The Three Independent Obstructions

The no-go theorem establishes that exact Yukawa ratios cannot be outputs
of (E1)–(E8) through three independent mechanisms. Each closes a different
loophole. Together they constitute a proof from which there is no escape
within the equation package.

---

### Obstruction 1: The Saturation System Is Blind to Basis Choice

The central structural fact is simple and devastating:

**Lemma ($\mathcal{G}_3$-invariance of $S_\Omega$).** For each fixed
proper-time scale $T > 0$, the Dirac-side record budget

$$
S_\Omega(\mathcal{D}_E;\,T)
\;=\; \sum_{n \geq 1} g(T\lambda_n)\, q(T\lambda_n)
$$

depends on the Yukawa matrices $(Y_u, Y_d, Y_e)$ **only through the
eigenvalues** $\{\lambda_n\}$ of $\mathcal{D}_E^2$. Eigenvalues are
invariant under unitary equivalence. Therefore $S_\Omega$ is constant
on $\mathcal{G}_3$-orbits.

The immediate consequence is decisive:

**Corollary.** The saturation equations (E8), $\Phi_k(y) = 0$ for
$k = 1, \ldots, N_{\mathrm{mass}}$, are constant on $\mathcal{G}_3$-orbits.
If $y^*$ satisfies (E8), then every point in the entire 45-dimensional
orbit $\mathcal{G}_3 \cdot y^*$ also satisfies (E8).

And more:

**Lemma (Orbit freedom is unconstrained).** No equation in (E1)–(E8)
constrains the $\mathcal{G}_3$-orbit direction of $y$. All eight equations
are $\mathcal{G}_3$-invariant - (E3) and (E8) by the eigenvalue argument
above, (E1) by unitarity of the spectral action, (E4)–(E7) because
$D_T(K)$ is independent of $y$ entirely.

The projection $\pi: \mathcal{M}_Y \to \mathcal{P}_3$ is a smooth
submersion. Any open neighborhood of $y^*$ in $\mathcal{M}_Y$ maps to an
open set in $\mathcal{P}_3$. Therefore:

$$
\mathrm{int}_{\mathcal{P}_3}(\mathcal{V}_3) \;\neq\; \emptyset.
$$

**The viable Yukawa set has nonempty interior in the physical manifold
$\mathcal{P}_3$.** The system does not select a point. It selects an
open region. Any exact Yukawa ratio would confine viability to a
positive-codimension subset, a set of measure zero which contradicts
this.

**Theorem (No admissible Yukawa selector).** There is no admissible map
from the solution set of (E1)–(E8) to $\mathcal{P}_3$ that outputs a
unique point without introducing additional equations constraining the
$\mathcal{G}_3$-orbit directions, equations that are not present in
(E1)–(E8).

The selector dichotomy is sharp: any rule built solely from the
Dirac–$\Lambda$ budgets and the Dirac spectrum is constant on
$\mathcal{G}_3$-orbits and therefore cannot distinguish points within
an orbit. To break the orbit degeneracy requires genuinely new structure.

---

### Obstruction 2: The Fermion Endomorphism Scalar Is Not Pinned

A potential loophole: even if the saturation equations cannot select a
unique orbit, perhaps a secondary spectral invariant visible to the
heat-kernel expansion is independently rigid?

The candidate is the **fermion endomorphism quadratic scalar**

$$
b(\mu_L)
\;:=\; \frac{1}{(4\pi)^2}\int_M \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathrm{ferm}}(E_Y^2)\,
\sqrt{g}\,d^4x
\;\geq\; 0,
$$

where $E_Y$ encodes the inter-generation Yukawa mixing in the fermion
block of the Dirac endomorphism. This quantity appears in the $a_4$
heat-kernel coefficient and is the leading Yukawa-mixing contribution
to the spectral action. It is $\mathcal{G}_3$-invariant and hence a
well-defined function on $\mathcal{P}_3$.

Could the capacity inequality or the saturation equations pin $b(\mu_L)$
to a specific value, thereby collapsing the orbit freedom?

**Proposition (Capacity inequality is one-sided in $b(\mu_L)$).**
The capacity inequality (E4) imposes a one-sided upper bound on the
total spectral sum $S_\Omega$. Reducing $b(\mu_L)$ - by taking $E_Y \to 0$
- reduces the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{D}_E^2$ (by the Weyl minimax
principle), which reduces $S_\Omega$, which makes (E4) *easier* to
satisfy. For any $b_0 \geq 0$, there exists a configuration with
$b(\mu_L) = b_0$ that satisfies (E4).

The capacity inequality provides no lower bound on $b(\mu_L)$.

**Theorem (No rigidity of $b(\mu_L)$).** The saturation equations (E8)
fix the total spectral sums $S_\Omega(\mathcal{D}_E(y);\,T_k) = D_{T_k}(K)$
at the active scales, but not $b(\mu_L)$ separately. Multiple configurations
with different values of $b(\mu_L)$ can achieve the same spectral sums by
compensating adjustments in the diagonal mass terms $E_{\mathrm{diag}}$.

The key supporting result, the non-total-saturation lemma also
matters here. If $S_\Omega(\mathcal{D}_E;\,T) = D_T(K)$ held for all
$T$ on an open interval, real-analyticity of $F(T) = S_\Omega(T) - D_T(K)$
and the identity principle would force $F \equiv 0$, which would require
the $g$-weighted spectral measure of $\mathcal{D}_E^2$ to exactly reproduce
the spectrum of the fixed operator $K$ - a per-background retuning
explicitly prohibited by the no-retuning condition (Assumption B4).
Therefore total saturation is impossible; saturation occurs only at
finitely many discrete active scales. The saturation equations fix the
spectral sum at those scales, not $b(\mu_L)$ independently.

**The fermion endomorphism loophole is closed.**

---

### Obstruction 3: All Other Fixed Outputs Are Orthogonal to the Yukawa Sector

The framework fixes several other quantities: the Born exponent $p = 2$,
the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, the cosmological constant $\Lambda_*$,
the generation number $N_g = 3$, and the full gauge scaffold. Could
conditioning on all of these simultaneously collapse the viable Yukawa
set to a point or discrete family?

**Lemma (Conditioning data are $y$-orthogonal).** The KKT stationarity
condition (E7) decomposes into three independent sectors:

$$
\frac{\delta\mathcal{S}}{\delta g_E}
+ \int \frac{\delta S_\Omega}{\delta g_E}\,d\mu = 0
\quad\text{(metric sector)},
$$

$$
\frac{\delta\mathcal{S}}{\delta A}
+ \int \frac{\delta S_\Omega}{\delta A}\,d\mu = 0
\quad\text{(gauge sector)},
$$

$$
\nabla_y\mathcal{S}
+ \int \nabla_y S_\Omega\,d\mu = 0
\quad\text{($y$-sector, equation (E8))}.
$$

The conditions fixing $p = 2$, $\alpha$, and $\Lambda_*$ arise from
the metric and gauge sectors. They add **zero equations** to the
$y$-sector. $N_g = 3$ fixes the dimension of $\mathcal{M}_Y$ but
imposes no constraint on the specific point $y^*$ within it. The
gauge scaffold is discrete and representation-theoretic orthogonal
to continuous Yukawa parameters.

**Theorem (Conditioning does not collapse $\mathcal{P}_3$).** After
conditioning on all fixed outputs of (E1)–(E8), the viable Yukawa set
still satisfies

$$
\mathrm{int}_{\mathcal{P}_3}\!\bigl(\mathcal{V}_3^{\mathrm{cond}}\bigr)
\;\neq\; \emptyset.
$$

If some nontrivial smooth function $f: \mathcal{P}_3 \to \mathbb{R}$
were universally constant on the viable set and encoding an exact mass
ratiom then the viable set would be contained in a level set
$f^{-1}(c)$. But a level set of a nontrivial smooth function on a
manifold has empty interior. This contradicts the nonempty interior
result. Therefore no such exact relation exists.

**The conditioning loophole is closed.**

---

## The Across-the-Board Corollary

Combining the three independent obstructions:

**Corollary (Across-the-board no-go for exact Yukawa prediction).**
Under the standing assumptions of the Coupled Dirac–$\Lambda$ framework,
with the discrete scaffold fixed and all other fixed outputs imported:

1. **No selector.** No admissible map from the solution set of
(E1)–(E8) to $\mathcal{P}_3$ outputs a unique physical Yukawa class
without introducing additional equations on the $\mathcal{G}_3$-orbit
directions.

2. **No endomorphism rigidity.** The fermion endomorphism quadratic
scalar $b(\mu_L) \geq 0$ satisfies only a universal lower bound; its
value is not determined by (E1)–(E8).

3. **No relational collapse.** After conditioning on all other fixed
outputs, the viable Yukawa set retains nonempty interior in
$\mathcal{P}_3$; no exact mass ratio is forced as a relational
consequence.

*Exact Yukawa ratios are not law-level outputs of the Coupled
Dirac–$\Lambda$ system (E1)–(E8).*

---

## The Same Boundary from Law Level: The Tier-0 Result

The no-go theorem above is a Tier-1 result. It operates inside the Coupled
Dirac–$\Lambda$ equation package (E1)–(E8) and establishes, using the
concrete machinery of spectral operators, heat-kernel coefficients, and
KKT stationarity, that the 45-dimensional orbit freedom of the flavor
redundancy group $\mathcal{G}_3$ is structurally unconstrained by the
equation system.

A separate paper establishes the **same boundary at Tier-0**, at the
level of lawhood itself, before any specific equation package is chosen:

> **An Across-the-Board No-Go Theorem for Exact Yukawa Prediction**
>
> Jeremy Rodgers - February 2026
>
> DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18493242](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18493242)

This is not a restatement of the Tier-1 result in different language.
It is an independent proof from more primitive assumptions, which
makes the conclusion significantly stronger. If the Tier-1 argument
showed that (E1)–(E8) cannot do it, the Tier-0 argument shows that
**no physically lawful framework can do it** because the obstruction
lives at the level of what lawhood itself requires, not at the level
of any particular equation system.

### What Tier-0 Lawhood Requires

The Tier-0 framework formalizes the minimal conditions under which a
theory deserves to be called physically lawful. These are not modeling
preferences, they are necessities:

**Closure stability** under $\Omega\Delta\partial$: a law description
must be a fixed point of the composite operator that canonicalizes
representations ($\partial$), extracts the record signature ($\Delta$),
and completes to a stable closure ($\Omega$). A law that does not
survive this cycle is not a law, it dissolves under its own
re-expression.

**No silent tie-breaking**: any law-level selection procedure must be
deterministic at the record level. If a construction is non-unique
under record-silent equivalence, the output must be set-valued unless
an explicit, record-visible selector criterion is provided. No numerical
value may be fixed by an unrecorded convention, arbitrary branch choice,
or hidden tuning parameter.

**Non-fine-tuned admissibility**: the viable set for any continuously
parameterized sector must have nonempty interior in the relevant
parameter manifold. Confinement to a set of measure zero, a single
point, a discrete family, or a positive-codimension subvariety is
forbidden unless a record-visible mechanism forces it.

These three axioms, applied to the physical Yukawa manifold
$\mathcal{P}_3 = (Y_u, Y_d, Y_e)/\mathcal{G}_3$, immediately block
any exact Yukawa prediction without new selector structure.

### The Tier-0 Argument in Three Steps

**Step 1 (No selector over $\mathcal{P}_3$).** Suppose a law-level
determinate Yukawa selector existed, a map that outputs a unique
point of $\mathcal{P}_3$ from the law structure alone. This would
confine viability to a single point or positive-codimension locus,
giving empty interior. This contradicts non-fine-tuned admissibility.
The no-silent-tie-breaking axiom then rules out rescuing the collapse
by arbitrary branch choice. Therefore no law-level selector over
$\mathcal{P}_3$ exists.

**Step 2 (No rigidity of the $\Omega$-visible Yukawa scalar).** The
strongest available loophole is that the admissible determinant
comparison through which Tier-0 selects other rigid invariants is
*budget-visible* to the Yukawa sector. Specifically, the inter-generation
mixing endomorphism $E_Y$ contributes to the $\mathrm{Str}(E^2)$
channel of the heat-package at fourth order, producing an
$\Omega$-projected quadratic scalar $b(\mu_L) \geq 0$. Could this
scalar be rigidly fixed by closure, thereby indirectly pinning Yukawa
ratios?

The answer is no. Closure imposes only the universal inequality
$b(\mu_L) \geq 0$ and admits a trivial branch $b(\mu_L) = 0$ when the
mixing component vanishes. No closure-forcing mechanism fixes the
numerical value. Budget visibility does not become law-level rigidity.

**Step 3 (No implicit fixation by conditioning).** The final loophole:
perhaps Yukawa ratios are not selected directly, but become implicitly
fixed once all other law-level invariants are conditioned on the gauge
scaffold, generation number $N_g = 3$, hypercharge normalization, the
Born exponent $p = 2$, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, the
cosmological constant $\Lambda_*$. Could the combination of all these
collapse $\mathcal{P}_3$ to a point?

No. The Tier-0 selection of $N_g = 3$ is itself a *robust* fixed-point
selection, it's certified precisely because the viable Yukawa set for
three generations has nonempty interior in $\mathcal{P}_3$. Conditioning
on $N_g = 3$ therefore preserves the interior, not destroys it. All
other fixed invariants are determined by conditions orthogonal to the
Yukawa sector. Conditioning adds zero new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_3$.
The viable set retains nonempty interior after full conditioning.

### The Tier-0 Across-the-Board Theorem

**Theorem (Tier-0 across-the-board no-go).** Under the physically
lawful axioms closure stability, no silent tie-breaking, and
non-fine-tuned admissibility, and with the full law-level scaffold
fixed (gauge group, $N_g = 3$, hypercharge normalization, $p = 2$,
$\alpha$, $\Lambda_*$):

$$
\mathrm{int}_{\mathcal{P}_3}\!\bigl(\mathcal{V}_3^{\mathrm{cond}}\bigr)
\;\neq\; \emptyset.
$$

No nontrivial exact algebraic relation among Yukawa invariants, no
exact mass ratio $m_e/m_t$, no mixing angle identity, no CP-phase
constraint, is a law-level output. Any proposal that predicts exact
Yukawa numbers must either introduce additional record-visible selector
structure acting on $\mathcal{P}_3$, or relax the lawhood axioms
themselves.

### Why Two Levels Makes the Result Stronger

The Tier-1 and Tier-0 results are logically independent. The Tier-1
proof works inside a specific equation package and shows the
$\mathcal{G}_3$-orbit freedom is not broken by any of (E1)–(E8).
The Tier-0 proof works from abstract lawhood axioms and shows the
same freedom cannot be broken by *any* closure-stable selection
procedure whatsoever.

Neither result implies the other. A critic of the Tier-1 result
could say: "perhaps a different equation package would do it." The
Tier-0 result forecloses that response, the obstruction is not in
the choice of equations, it is in the axioms of lawhood. A critic
of the Tier-0 result could say: "perhaps those axioms are too
restrictive for a concrete physical framework." The Tier-1 result
forecloses that response even within the fully specified Coupled
Dirac–$\Lambda$ system, the boundary holds by explicit computation.

The two results converge on the same boundary from opposite directions.
That convergence is not a coincidence. Tier-1 and Tier-0 express the
same constraint at different levels of abstraction and the constraint
they agree on is: **exact fermion mass ratios are not what laws
determine.**

---

## What the No-Go Theorem Is Not Saying

This result requires careful reading. It is not saying:

**That the Yukawa sector is unconstrained.** The saturation system
(E8) locally determines the Yukawa parameter vector given fixed
external data. The framework constrains the Yukawa sector; it just
does not universally select a unique point in $\mathcal{P}_3$.

**That flavor hierarchies cannot be qualitatively explained.**
The framework may well explain *why* hierarchies exist through
the structure of the saturation mechanism and the heat-kernel
coefficients without predicting the exact numerical values.

**That Yukawa data are irrelevant to the spectral action.** The
Yukawa matrices enter through the endomorphism $\mathbf{E}$ of the
Dirac operator and affect the spectral action coefficients. They are
not invisible, they are just underdetermined at the orbit level.

**That no extension can predict Yukawa ratios.** The no-go theorem
is a statement about (E1)–(E8) as currently defined. It identifies
exactly what is missing: additional equations constraining the
$\mathcal{G}_3$-orbit directions in $\mathcal{M}_Y$. Any extension
claiming to predict exact mass ratios must supply this structure.
This is not a criticism, it's a precise specification of what
the next level of the theory must contain.

---

## The Contrast With Rigid Invariants

The Yukawa sector is not undetermined because the framework is weak.
It is undetermined because the specific fixing mechanisms available
in (E1)–(E8) do not reach the $\mathcal{G}_3$-orbit directions.

Compare with what *is* fixed:

      <td><strong>Not fixed</strong></td>
      <td><strong>$\mathcal{G}_3$-orbit underdetermined</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The gauge group is forced because every enlargement violates a quantitative
inequality. The strong CP phase is forced because $\theta \neq 0$ destroys
the positive-norm Hilbert space. These are structural necessities, there
is no way through.

Exact Yukawa ratios are different. The system constrains them to a region.
That region has nonempty interior. There is room to move within it without
violating any equation in (E1)–(E8). The freedom is not a gap in the
framework, it is a precisely characterised residual, with a precise
mathematical description of what additional structure would close it.

---

## A Precise Specification for What Comes Next

The no-go theorem is, in this sense, a **construction guide** for the
next layer of the theory.

Any framework that genuinely predicts exact Yukawa ratios must introduce
equations that:

- Are not already present in (E1)–(E8),
- Are not $\mathcal{G}_3$-invariant (otherwise they cannot distinguish
  orbit directions),
- Are record-visible (otherwise they are physically meaningless),
- Break the orbit degeneracy in $\mathcal{M}_Y$ in a way that collapses
  $\mathcal{V}_3$ to a subset of empty interior in $\mathcal{P}_3$.

This is a precise characterization. It tells you exactly what a
predictive theory of Yukawa couplings must contain, not by analogy
or intuition, but by theorem.

The Coupled Dirac–$\Lambda$ framework has drawn a precise boundary
between what is structurally forced and what requires additional input.
The gauge group of the universe is on one side of that boundary.
The fermion mass ratios are on the other.

Both facts are equally informative.
