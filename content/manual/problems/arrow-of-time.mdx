# Arrow of Time and Time Asymmetry

## Time does not flow because dynamics say so.

## It flows because irreversibility is forced.

Most physical laws are time-reversal symmetric.
Yet the world is not. 

Entropy increases. Records accumulate. Radiation disperses. Memory works in one direction only.

For a century, physics has tried to explain this asymmetry by adding ***'something extra'***:
special initial conditions, coarse-graining choices, environments, observers, or appeals to probability.

This program takes a sharper position:

> **The arrow of time is not an assumption, not a convention, and not a psychological artifact.
> It is a structural consequence of spectral positivity and calibrated dissipation.**

The supporting papers provide the proofs.
This page provides the logic.

## Central Claim

Within a broad but explicit admissible class of quantum systems, irreversibility is unavoidable once three conditions are met:

1. spectral positivity,
2. calibrated coarse-graining,
3. finite propagation of information.

From these alone, one obtains:

* a **strictly monotone Lyapunov functional** after a finite crossover time,
* a **quantitative arrow of time** compatible with unitary, open, and cosmological regimes,
* and a sharp **no-go theorem** showing exactly when a universal arrow is impossible.

This is not “entropy usually increases.”
This is **a theorem with failure modes**.

---

## Limitations of the Standard Framing

Traditional accounts of the arrow of time fall into three categories:

* **Statistical**: entropy increases because typical states are high-entropy.
* **Environmental**: openness, decoherence, or baths create irreversibility.
* **Cosmological**: the Past Hypothesis sets a low-entropy boundary.

Each captures part of the truth but none explains why irreversibility becomes mandatory once certain structural features are present.

This framework isolates the missing piece:

> **Irreversibility arises when spectral transfer exceeds a calibrated dissipation floor.**

Not as a story. As an inequality.

## The engine: spectral thermodynamics

The construction does not start with entropy.
It starts with spectral data.

Given a canonical generator built from:

* a geometric Dirac-type core, and
* a calibrated boundary bridge,

one extracts a **boundary spectral slope** that splits canonically into:

* a continuous (AC) sector, and
* a discrete (atomic) sector.

This split is not optional. It is guaranteed by general Herglotz theory and positivity.

From this single object, one builds:

* heat-scale spectral packets,
* a calibrated evaluator that kills spurious drift,
* and a log-determinant Lyapunov functional.

The arrow of time is not postulated, it's read off from how this object evolves.

---

## The key mechanism: floor versus budget

At each spectral scale, two forces compete:

* the dissipation floor, coming from calibrated spectral weight inside the packet window,
* the budget, coming from leakage outside the window.

The central result is brutally simple:

> **After a finite crossover time, the floor dominates the budget.
> From that point on, monotonic decay is forced.**

This is not asymptotic hand-waving.
The crossover time is finite, explicit, and measurable.

---

## What “time asymmetry” means here

Time asymmetry is not defined by clocks or coordinates.

It is defined operationally:

* a functional exists that **cannot increase** under admissible evolution,
* and **strictly decreases** once the crossover is passed.

This functional is built from spectral transfer alone, no probabilistic assumptions, no observer dependence.

That is the arrow.

---

## Sharp No-Go Theorem and Its Significance

The framework also proves something negative and important:

> **There is no strictly monotone arrow for all finite closed systems under exact unitary evolution.**

This is not a limitation of the method.
It is a mathematical obstruction.

Poincaré recurrence and unitary reversibility forbid a universal arrow in that regime.

This no-go result does two things:

* it prevents overclaiming,
* and it precisely identifies what must be added for an arrow to exist.

---

## The universality envelope 

Within that constraint, the framework achieves maximal universality:

* **Open systems (GKLS / CPTP)**: strict arrow from spectral dissipation.
* **Systems with continuous spectrum**: strict arrow from AC transfer.
* **Integrable or many-body localized systems**: arrow via vanishing dephasing or explicit coarse-graining.
* **Finite closed systems**: almost-monotone arrow, with exceptions of zero density.
* **Cosmological settings**: a global arrow under a Past Hypothesis, compatible with horizon thermodynamics.

Each regime is treated explicitly. None are hand-waved.

---

## Energy conditions lock the direction

The arrow here is not free to point both ways.

Universal quantum energy inequalities, a sharp quantum null energy condition, and a full generalized second law are all derived from the same spectral construction.

These results mean:

* negative-energy fluctuations are bounded,
* entropy production has a fixed sign,
* and time-reversed decay is structurally forbidden once the conditions are met.

The arrow is ***aligned*** with energy flow, not chosen independently.

---

## Light, horizons, and irreversibility

Null propagation plays a special role:

* light carries no proper time,
* but it carries coherence.

The framework cleanly separates:

* null coherence channels, and
* record-bearing timelike channels.

Irreversibility lives in the latter.

This is why the construction naturally interfaces with:

* Unruh and Hawking thermality,
* horizon entropy,
* and cosmological time asymmetry.

---

## Claims and Non-Claims

**Claimed:**

* A quantitative arrow of time follows from spectral positivity and calibrated dissipation.
* A strictly monotone Lyapunov functional exists after finite crossover in all admissible regimes.
* A universal arrow is impossible for finite closed unitary systems, and the obstruction is explicit.
* Energy conditions and the arrow share a single spectral origin.

**Not claimed:**

* That entropy always increases in every imaginable system.
* That time asymmetry is psychological or observer-dependent.
* That classical intuition alone explains the arrow.
* That dynamics must be modified.

---

## Significance

This reframes the arrow of time from a philosophical problem into a structural one.

The question is no longer:
“Why does entropy increase?”

It is:

> **When does spectral transfer force irreversibility and when is it mathematically impossible?**

This framework answers both.
