# Grand Unified Theory (Test Notes)

If you can see this text under **Notes** on the Grand Unified Theory problem page, then:

1) the manual MDX pipeline is working, and  
2) the issue with Standard Model is inside that MDX file’s content (parse/import failure).

## Next step

If this test renders correctly, we’ll fix the Standard Model MDX by removing MDX hazards (most commonly unescaped `{` `}` in LaTeX).
