# Structural Reconstruction of the Standard Model (Determinant-Closed SO(10))

The Standard Model (SM) is an extraordinarily successful infrared theory — and it is also structurally unforgiving. Its gauge group, chiral fermion content, hypercharge quantization, and anomaly cancellations admit many algebraically conceivable “nearby” alternatives. Historically, we have treated the observed structure as contingent: something that works, but could have been otherwise.

This article presents the core reconstruction claim of the accompanying paper:

**Within a determinant-closed SO(10) unification carrier, and under a strict admissibility discipline, the infrared Standard Model gauge group and one-generation chiral fermion content are not chosen — they are inherited as the complete restriction of a single SO(10) spinor (16_F), with embedding-fixed hypercharge and automatic anomaly cancellation.**

This is a reconstruction, not model-building. No symmetry-breaking history is assumed. No RG numerics. No Yukawas or masses. No speculative UV completion. Only representation theory plus admissibility.

## What is being reconstructed

The reconstruction target is the observed infrared record:

* Gauge group: (SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y)
* One-generation chiral fermion content (LH Weyl), including a right-handed neutrino (\nu_R)
* Hypercharge quantization and normalization (not treated as tunable)
* Cancellation of all relevant 4D anomalies: local gauge, mixed gauge, mixed gauge–gravity, and Witten’s (SU(2)_L) global anomaly

The central claim is **not** “SO(10) can contain the Standard Model” — that is textbook material.

The claim is:

**Once admissibility is enforced as a selection criterion, only the complete restriction of a determinant-closed carrier — with embedding-fixed hypercharge and no low-energy chiral exotics — survives.**

Everything else fails.

## The two constraints that force the result

### 1) Determinant-closed carrier (imported)

The paper imports the carrier selection: (SO(10)) (or (Spin(10))) as dominance-minimal within the declared admissibility and budget discipline.

This choice is conservative, not ambitious. (SO(10)) is the minimal simple carrier capable of hosting a full chiral generation — including (\nu_R) — without requiring low-energy chiral add-ons. Nothing smaller works without patching.

---

### 2) Embedding-fixed hypercharge (no rescaling freedom)

Hypercharge is not allowed to float.

The reconstruction treats (U(1)_Y) normalization as inherited from embedding into a simple carrier. Arbitrary rescalings, ad hoc abelian mixing, and independent charge assignments are explicitly forbidden.

The conventional normalization — equivalent to (k_Y = 5/3) — is fixed by the embedding.

This single restriction deletes a vast class of “almost-SM” counterexamples. Historically, the abelian sector is where pathological models hide. Here, it is locked.

---

## The descent: restriction, not history

For representation bookkeeping, the reconstruction uses the standard chain

(SO(10) \supset SU(5) \supset SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y),

or equivalently the Pati–Salam route. These are representation-theoretically equivalent for fixing (Y) and decomposing (16_F).

This chain is **not** asserted as a symmetry-breaking history. It is used only to identify the embedded (U(1)_Y) generator and perform restriction.

---

## One generation from one irreducible: the (16_F)

The sharpest statement of the reconstruction is simple:

**One generation comes from one irreducible.**

* A full chiral generation is hosted by a single SO(10) spinor (16_F).
* The infrared fermion spectrum is the *complete restriction* of (16_F).
* No incomplete multiplets and no extra low-energy chiral exotics are permitted.

The resulting one-generation spectrum (LH Weyl notation) is:

* (Q_L : (3,2)_{+1/6})
* (u^c_R : (\bar 3,1)_{-2/3})
* (d^c_R : (\bar 3,1)_{+1/3})
* (L_L : (1,2)_{-1/2})
* (e^c_R : (1,1)_{+1})
* (\nu_R : (1,1)_0)

Two consequences follow immediately:

1. **Chirality is inherited.** Vectorlike pairing at the SM scale requires adding conjugates, which admissibility forbids.
2. **(\nu_R) is structural.** It appears because the representation forces it, not because neutrino phenomenology demands it.

#### Minimality signal: (\nu_R) is not a bolt-on

A clean diagnostic separating hosting from patching:

* (SO(10):\ 16) (with (\nu_R) internal)
* (SU(5)+\nu_R:\ 10 \oplus \bar 5 \oplus 1) (with (\nu_R) appended)

Under the reconstruction discipline, “add a singlet to fix it” is not allowed.

---

## Hypercharge quantization: discrete, not adjustable

Here, “hypercharge quantization” means:

* (Y) is an embedded generator in (\mathfrak{so}(10))
* Each multiplet’s charge is fixed discretely by representation weights
* Fractional electric charge is inherited, not tuned

No rescaling of (Y).
No arbitrary abelian mixing.
No RG numerics or coupling unification required.

Charge structure is pure embedding plus representation theory.

---

## Anomaly cancellation: inherited, not engineered

A reconstruction that needs extra chiral matter to cancel anomalies is not a reconstruction — it is a repair.

Here, anomaly cancellation follows automatically from the completeness of the (16_F) restriction with embedding-fixed hypercharge.

The one-generation spectrum satisfies:

* Local gauge anomalies: ([SU(3)_c]^3), ([SU(2)_L]^3), ([U(1)_Y]^3)
* Mixed anomalies: ([SU(3)_c]^2 U(1)_Y), ([SU(2)_L]^2 U(1)_Y)
* Mixed gauge–gravity: (U(1)_Y[\text{Gravity}]^2)
* Global anomaly: Witten (SU(2)_L) condition

Representative cancellations:

**([SU(3)_c]^2 U(1)_Y)**
(1/6 - 1/3 + 1/6 = 0)

**([SU(2)_L]^2 U(1)_Y)**
(1/4 - 1/4 = 0)

**Witten (SU(2)_L)**
Four LH doublets per generation → even → allowed

No tuning. No fixes. No freedom.

## Three generations: imported by design

This paper does not derive the generation count. It imports (N_g = 3) and uses it only as a multiplicity factor. Anomalies cancel additively.

This separation is deliberate. It keeps the structural reconstruction clean and auditable.

---

## Why this is resolution-class (structurally)

Without sociological claims, the reconstruction has the hallmarks of a genuine resolution:

1. **Hard scope control** — nothing extra is smuggled in.
2. **Import discipline** — carrier selection and (N_g) are fixed inputs.
3. **Necessity via exclusion** — admissibility forbids:

   * extra unbroken gauge factors,
   * hypercharge rescaling or mixing,
   * low-energy chiral exotics,
   * incomplete carrier restriction.
4. **One irreducible hosts one generation** — including (\nu_R).

An expert can audit every step.

## How to verify it quickly

1. Check the one-generation spectrum (including (\nu_R)).
2. Check embedding-fixed hypercharge normalization.
3. Verify mixed anomalies.
4. Verify cubic and gravitational anomalies.
5. Check the Witten (SU(2)_L) condition.
6. Confirm no extra chiral exotics were added.

If these pass, the conclusion follows.
